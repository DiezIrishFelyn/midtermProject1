                <h4>Signs of the Second Coming of Jesus</h4>
                <h5>a. Spiritual Famine</h5>
                <h6><strong> Amos 4:7–8 </strong></h6>
                <p>And also I have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city: one piece was rained on, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. So two or three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.</p>
                <h6><strong> Matthew 24:12 </strong></h6>
                <p>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</p>

                <h5>b. The Appearance of the War, Famine, and Earthquakes</h5>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:6-8</strong></h6>
                <p>And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
                
                <h5>c. The Restoration of Israel</h5>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:32-33</strong></h6>
                <p>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near: So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</p>
                <h6><strong>Luke 21:29-32</strong></h6>
                <p>And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; When they now shoot forth, you see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand. So likewise you, when you see these things come to pass, know you that the kingdom of God is near at hand. Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p>

                <h5>d. Visions Appeared in the Stars</h5>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:29</strong></h6>
                <p>Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</p>
                <h6><strong>Revelation 6:12</strong></h6>
                <p>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.</p>

                <h5>e. The Gospel Spreads to the Ends of the Earth</h5>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:14</strong></h6>
                <p>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.</p>
                
                <h5>f. The Appearance of False Christs and Antichrists</h5>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:4-5</strong></h6>
                <p>And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p>
                <h6><strong>Matthew 24:23-26</strong></h6>
                <p>Then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.</p>

                <h5><strong>From the verses above, we can see that these prophecies about the Lord Jesus’ return have been fulfilled. Perhaps many people will ask, “If the Lord has come back, why haven’t we welcomed Him?”</strong></h5>

            <h2 class="display-10 text-light bg-dark">HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE SAVED?</h2>
            <h3 class="display-10 text-light bg-dark">Jesus Christ gives salvation by grace through faith.</h3>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Your heart tends to run from God and rebel against Him. The Bible calls this "sin." <em>Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Yet God loves you and wants to save you from sin, to offer you a new life of hope. <em>John 10:10 says, "I have come that they may have life and have it in abundance."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">To give you this gift of salvation, God made a way through His Son, Jesus Christ. <em>Romans 5:8 says, "But God proves His own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">You receive this gift by faith alone. <em> Ephesians 2:8 says, "For you are saved by grace through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God's gift—not from works, so that no one can boast."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">Faith is a decision of your heart demonstrated by the actions of your life. <em>Romans 10:9 says, "If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark">If you trust that Jesus died for your sins and to receive new life through Him, pray a prayer similar to this to express your repentance and faith in Him:</p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark"><em>"Dear God, I know I am a sinner. I believe Jesus died to forgive me of my sins. I now accept Your offer of eternal life. Thank You for forgiving me of all my sin. Thank You for my new life. From this day forward, I will choose to follow You."</em></p>
            <p class="lead text-light bg-dark"></p>
